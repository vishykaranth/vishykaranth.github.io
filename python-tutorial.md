## Python

Python is a high-level, dynamically typed multiparadigm programming language.
Python code looks like pseudocode, it express very powerful ideas in very few lines of code.

```python
def quicksort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]
    left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]
    middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]
    right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]
    return quicksort(left) + middle + quicksort(right)

print(quicksort([3,6,8,10,1,2,1]))
# Prints "[1, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 10]"
```

### Basic data types

Like most languages, Python has a number of basic types including integers,
floats, booleans, and strings. These data types behave in ways that are
familiar from other programming languages.

**Numbers:** Integers and floats work as you would expect from other languages:

```python
x = 3
print(type(x)) # Prints "<class 'int'>"
print(x)       # Prints "3"
print(x + 1)   # Addition; prints "4"
print(x - 1)   # Subtraction; prints "2"
print(x * 2)   # Multiplication; prints "6"
print(x ** 2)  # Exponentiation; prints "9"
x += 1
print(x)  # Prints "4"
x *= 2
print(x)  # Prints "8"
y = 2.5
print(type(y)) # Prints "<class 'float'>"
print(y, y + 1, y * 2, y ** 2) # Prints "2.5 3.5 5.0 6.25"
```
Note that unlike many languages, Python does not have unary increment (`x++`)
or decrement (`x--`) operators.

Python also has built-in types for complex numbers;
you can find all of the details
[in the documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/stdtypes.html#numeric-types-int-float-complex).

**Booleans:** Python implements all of the usual operators for Boolean logic,
but uses English words rather than symbols (`&&`, `||`, etc.):

```python
t = True
f = False
print(type(t)) # Prints "<class 'bool'>"
print(t and f) # Logical AND; prints "False"
print(t or f)  # Logical OR; prints "True"
print(not t)   # Logical NOT; prints "False"
print(t != f)  # Logical XOR; prints "True"
```

**Strings:** Python has great support for strings:

```python
hello = 'hello'    # String literals can use single quotes
world = "world"    # or double quotes; it does not matter.
print(hello)       # Prints "hello"
print(len(hello))  # String length; prints "5"
hw = hello + ' ' + world  # String concatenation
print(hw)  # prints "hello world"
hw12 = '%s %s %d' % (hello, world, 12)  # sprintf style string formatting
print(hw12)  # prints "hello world 12"
```

String objects have a bunch of useful methods; for example:

```python
s = "hello"
print(s.capitalize())  # Capitalize a string; prints "Hello"
print(s.upper())       # Convert a string to uppercase; prints "HELLO"
print(s.rjust(7))      # Right-justify a string, padding with spaces; prints "  hello"
print(s.center(7))     # Center a string, padding with spaces; prints " hello "
print(s.replace('l', '(ell)'))  # Replace all instances of one substring with another;
                                # prints "he(ell)(ell)o"
print('  world '.strip())  # Strip leading and trailing whitespace; prints "world"
```
You can find a list of all string methods [in the documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods).

### Containers
Python includes several built-in container types: lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples.

<a name='python-lists'></a>

#### Lists
A list is the Python equivalent of an array, but is resizeable
and can contain elements of different types:

```python
xs = [3, 1, 2]    # Create a list
print(xs, xs[2])  # Prints "[3, 1, 2] 2"
print(xs[-1])     # Negative indices count from the end of the list; prints "2"
xs[2] = 'foo'     # Lists can contain elements of different types
print(xs)         # Prints "[3, 1, 'foo']"
xs.append('bar')  # Add a new element to the end of the list
print(xs)         # Prints "[3, 1, 'foo', 'bar']"
x = xs.pop()      # Remove and return the last element of the list
print(x, xs)      # Prints "bar [3, 1, 'foo']"
```
As usual, you can find all the gory details about lists
[in the documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.5/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists).

**Slicing:**
In addition to accessing list elements one at a time, Python provides
concise syntax to access sublists; this is known as *slicing*:

```python
nums = list(range(5))     # range is a built-in function that creates a list of integers
print(nums)               # Prints "[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]"
print(nums[2:4])          # Get a slice from index 2 to 4 (exclusive); prints "[2, 3]"
print(nums[2:])           # Get a slice from index 2 to the end; prints "[2, 3, 4]"
print(nums[:2])           # Get a slice from the start to index 2 (exclusive); prints "[0, 1]"
print(nums[:])            # Get a slice of the whole list; prints "[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]"
print(nums[:-1])          # Slice indices can be negative; prints "[0, 1, 2, 3]"
nums[2:4] = [8, 9]        # Assign a new sublist to a slice
print(nums)               # Prints "[0, 1, 8, 9, 4]"
```
We will see slicing again in the context of numpy arrays.

**Loops:** You can loop over the elements of a list like this:

```python
animals = ['cat', 'dog', 'monkey']
for animal in animals:
    print(animal)
# Prints "cat", "dog", "monkey", each on its own line.
```

If you want access to the index of each element within the body of a loop,
use the built-in `enumerate` function:

```python
animals = ['cat', 'dog', 'monkey']
for idx, animal in enumerate(animals):
    print('#%d: %s' % (idx + 1, animal))
# Prints "#1: cat", "#2: dog", "#3: monkey", each on its own line
```

**List comprehensions:**
When programming, frequently we want to transform one type of data into another.
As a simple example, consider the following code that computes square numbers:

```python
nums = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
squares = []
for x in nums:
    squares.append(x ** 2)
print(squares)   # Prints [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]
```

You can make this code simpler using a **list comprehension**:

```python
nums = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
squares = [x ** 2 for x in nums]
print(squares)   # Prints [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]
```

List comprehensions can also contain conditions:

```python
nums = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
even_squares = [x ** 2 for x in nums if x % 2 == 0]
print(even_squares)  # Prints "[0, 4, 16]"
```
