This is a collection of books that I've researched, scanned the TOCs of, and am currently working through.&nbsp; The books are selected based on quality of content, reviews, and reccommendations of various 'best of' lists.

The goal of this collection is to promote mastery of generally applicable programming concepts.

Most topics are covered with Python as the primary language due to its conciseness, which is ideal for learning & practicing new concepts with minimal syntactic boilerplate.

JavaScript & Kotlin are listed in the `Tooling` section; as they allow extension of `VS Code` and the `IntelliJ` suite of IDEs, which cover most development needs.
