# Managing transactions

## ACID Transactions

Typically, when we talk about database transactions, we are talking about ACID transactions.

ACID stands for atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability, and here is what these properties give us:

**Atomicity**
Ensures that all operations completed within the transaction either all complete or all fail. If any of the changes
we’re trying to make fail for some reason, then the whole operation is aborted, and it’s as though no changes were ever
made.

**Consistency**
When changes are made to our database, we ensure it is left in a valid, consistent state.

**Isolation**
Allows multiple transactions to operate at the same time without interfering. This is achieved by ensuring that any
interim state changes made during one transaction are invisible to other transactions.

**Durability**
Makes sure that once a transaction has been completed, we are confident the data won’t get lost in the event of some
system failure.

## What is a distributed transaction?

When a microservice architecture decomposes a monolithic system into self-encapsulated services, it can break
transactions. This means a local transaction in the monolithic system is now distributed into multiple services that
will be called in a sequence.

Here is a customer order example with a monolithic system using a local transaction:

In the customer order example above, if a user sends a Put Order action to a monolithic system, the system will create a
local database transaction that works over multiple database tables. If any step fails, the transaction can roll back.
This is known as ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability), which is guaranteed by the database system.

When we decompose this system, we created both the `CustomerMicroserviceand` the `OrderMicroservice`, which have
separate databases. Here is a customer order example with microservices:


<img src="./images-ms/customer order example with microservices.png" width="600" />

When a Put Order request comes from the user, both microservices will be called to apply changes into their own
database. Because the transaction is now across multiple databases, it is now considered a _distributed transaction_.

**What is the problem?**
In a monolithic system, we have a database system to ensure ACIDity. We now need to clarify the following key problems.

**How do we keep the transaction atomic?**
In a database system, atomicity means that in a transaction either all steps complete or no steps complete. The
microservice-based system does not have a global transaction coordinator by default. In the example above, if
the `CreateOrder` method fails, how do we roll back the changes we applied by the `CustomerMicroservice`?

**Do we isolate user actions for concurrent requests?**
If an object is written by a transaction and at the same time (before the transaction ends), it is read by another
request, should the object return old data or updated data? In the example above, once UpdateCustomerFund succeeds but
is still waiting for a response from CreateOrder, should requests for the current customer's fund return the updated
amount or not?

**Possible solutions**

The problems above are important for microservice-based systems. Otherwise, there is no way to tell if a transaction has
completed successfully. The following two patterns can resolve the problem:

1. 2pc (two-phase commit)
2. Saga

## Two-phase commit (2pc) pattern

2pc is widely used in database systems. For some situations, you can use 2pc for microservices. Just be careful; not all
situations suit 2pc and, in fact, 2pc is considered impractical within a microservice architecture (explained below).

So what is a two-phase commit?

As its name hints, 2pc has two phases: A prepare phase and a commit phase. In the prepare phase, all microservices will
be asked to prepare for some data change that could be done atomically. Once all microservices are prepared, the commit
phase will ask all the microservices to make the actual changes.

Normally, there needs to be a global coordinator to maintain the lifecycle of the transaction, and the coordinator will
need to call the microservices in the prepare and commit phases.

Here is a 2pc implementation for the customer order example:

<img src="./images-ms/2pc implementation for the customer order .png" width="600" />

In the example above, when a user sends a put order request, the Coordinator will first create a global transaction with
all the context information. It will then tell CustomerMicroservice to prepare for updating a customer fund with the
created transaction. The CustomerMicroservice will then check, for example, if the customer has enough funds to proceed
with the transaction. Once CustomerMicroservice is OK to perform the change, it will lock down the object from further
changes and tell the Coordinator that it is prepared. The same thing happens while creating the order in the
OrderMicroservice. Once the Coordinator has confirmed all microservices are ready to apply their changes, it will then
ask them to apply their changes by requesting a commit with the transaction. At this point, all objects will be
unlocked.

If at any point a single microservice fails to prepare, the Coordinator will abort the transaction and begin the
rollback process. Here is a diagram of a 2pc rollback for the customer order example:

<img src="./images-ms/2pc rollback for the customer order .png" width="600" />

In the above example, the CustomerMicroservice failed to prepare for some reason, but the OrderMicroservice has replied
that it is prepared to create the order. The Coordinator will request an abort on the OrderMicroservice with the
transaction and the OrderMicroservice will then roll back any changes made and unlock the database objects.

### Benefits of using 2pc

2pc is a very strong consistency protocol. First, the prepare and commit phases guarantee that the transaction is
atomic. The transaction will end with either all microservices returning successfully or all microservices have nothing
changed. Secondly, 2pc allows read-write isolation. This means the changes on a field are not visible until the
coordinator commits the changes.

### Disadvantages of using 2pc

While 2pc has solved the problem, it is not really recommended for many microservice-based systems because 2pc is
synchronous (blocking). The protocol will need to lock the object that will be changed before the transaction completes.
In the example above, if a customer places an order, the "fund" field will be locked for the customer. This prevents the
customer from applying new orders. This makes sense because if a "prepared" object changed after it claims it is "
prepared," then the commit phase could possibly not work.

This is not good. In a database system, transactions tend to be fast—normally within 50 ms. However, microservices have
long delays with RPC calls, especially when integrating with external services such as a payment service. The lock could
become a system performance bottleneck. Also, it is possible to have two transactions mutually lock each other (
deadlock) when each transaction requests a lock on a resource the other requires.

## Saga pattern

The Saga pattern is another widely used pattern for distributed transactions. It is different from 2pc, which is
synchronous. The Saga pattern is asynchronous and reactive. In a Saga pattern, the distributed transaction is fulfilled
by asynchronous local transactions on all related microservices. The microservices communicate with each other through
an event bus.

Here is a diagram of the Saga pattern for the customer order example:

<img src="./images-ms/Saga pattern for the customer order.png" width="600" />

In the example above, the OrderMicroservice receives a request to place an order. It first starts a local transaction to
create an order and then emits an OrderCreated event. The CustomerMicroservice listens for this event and updates a
customer fund once the event is received. If a deduction is successfully made from a fund, a CustomerFundUpdated event
will then be emitted, which in this example means the end of the transaction.

If any microservice fails to complete its local transaction, the other microservices will run compensation transactions
to rollback the changes. Here is a diagram of the Saga pattern for a compensation transaction:

<img src="./images-ms/Saga pattern for a compensation transaction.png" width="600" />

In the above example, the UpdateCustomerFund failed for some reason and it then emitted a CustomerFundUpdateFailed
event. The OrderMicroservice listens for the event and start its compensation transaction to revert the order that was
created.

### Advantages of the Saga pattern

One big advantage of the Saga pattern is its support for long-lived transactions. Because each microservice focuses only
on its own local atomic transaction, other microservices are not blocked if a microservice is running for a long time.
This also allows transactions to continue waiting for user input. Also, because all local transactions are happening in
parallel, there is no lock on any object.

### Disadvantages of the Saga pattern

The Saga pattern is difficult to debug, especially when many microservices are involved. Also, the event messages could
become difficult to maintain if the system gets complex. Another disadvantage of the Saga pattern is it does not have
read isolation. For example, the customer could see the order being created, but in the next second, the order is
removed due to a compensation transaction.

**Adding a process manager**
To address the complexity issue of the Saga pattern, it is quite normal to add a process manager as an orchestrator. The
process manager is responsible for listening to events and triggering endpoints.
