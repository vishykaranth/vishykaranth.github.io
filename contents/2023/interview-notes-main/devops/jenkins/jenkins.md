Continuous delivery
--------

Continuous delivery is a software engineering practice in which agile teams produce software in continuous low-risk short cycles, ensuring that software can be reliably released at any time. This makes it possible to continuously adapt software inline with user feedback and changes in business requirements.

In this methodology Development, Test, Support and Operations work together as one delivery team to automate the streamline the build-test-release process as much as possible.

By following continuous delivery approach, a single commit in git repository can trigger the automated delivery pipeline taking your code to production, making it available to customers.

If you are using Jenkins, AWS, and CodeDeploy, then the pipeline might look like below:
