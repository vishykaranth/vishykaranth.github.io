   - Provides suggestions

2. Human reviewer validates
   - Verifies AI findings
   - Adds domain expertise
   - Checks business logic

3. Collaborative improvement
   - Developer addresses issues
   - AI and human re-review
   - Final approval
```

**Best Practice 2: Focus on High-Value Reviews**
```markdown
# Review Prioritization

High Priority (AI + Human):
- Security-sensitive code
- Critical business logic
- Complex algorithms
- Performance-critical code

Medium Priority (AI First):
- Standard CRUD operations
- Boilerplate code
- Test code
- Documentation

Low Priority (AI Only):
- Simple utilities
- Configuration files
- Comments
```

**Best Practice 3: Learn from AI Reviews**
```markdown
# Learning from AI

1. Study AI suggestions
2. Understand patterns
3. Apply learnings to future code
4. Share knowledge with team
5. Update coding standards
```

### 2.3 Security Best Practices

**Security Practice 1: Never Trust AI Blindly**
```java
/**
 * SECURITY BEST PRACTICE: Always verify security
 * 
 * AI-generated code may have:
 * - Hardcoded credentials
 * - SQL injection risks
 * - XSS vulnerabilities
 * - Insecure defaults
 * 
 * Always perform security review!
 */
```

**Security Practice 2: Use Security-Focused Prompts**
```
SECURE CODE PROMPT:

"Create secure authentication code with:
- Password hashing (BCrypt)
- JWT token validation
- Rate limiting
- Input validation
- Error handling without information leakage
- Security best practices (OWASP)"
```

**Security Practice 3: Security Review Checklist**

- Reduced bugs
- Faster delivery

Costs:
- Tool licenses
- Training time
- Review overhead
- Infrastructure
```

**Example Calculation**:
```markdown
# ROI Example

Costs:
- GitHub Copilot: $10/user/month × 50 users = $500/month
- Training: 40 hours × $100/hour = $4,000 (one-time)
- Review overhead: 10% increase = $2,000/month

Total Monthly Cost: $2,500

Benefits:
- 5x faster on repetitive tasks: 20 hours saved/user/month
- 20 hours × $100/hour × 50 users = $100,000/month
- Quality improvements: $10,000/month (reduced bugs)
- Faster delivery: $15,000/month (time to market)

Total Monthly Benefits: $125,000

ROI = ($125,000 - $2,500) / $2,500 × 100 = 4,900%
```
