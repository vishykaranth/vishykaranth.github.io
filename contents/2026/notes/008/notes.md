## Notes, 

- Built a production-grade configuration and secrets management platform using Java 17, Spring Boot 3.3.11, Consul, and HashiCorp Vault, supporting hierarchical configurations (tenant/environment/app/org), schema-based validation, automatic secret separation, and preference management. Implemented REST APIs with circuit breaker resilience, config reference resolution, format conversion (JSON to properties), and deployed on Kubernetes with comprehensive monitoring achieving sub-100ms response times.
