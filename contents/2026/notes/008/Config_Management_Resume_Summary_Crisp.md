# Config Management Service - Crisp 2-Liner Resume Summary

## Option 1: Technical Focus

Developed a production-grade configuration and secrets management platform using Java 17, Spring Boot 3.3.11, Consul, and HashiCorp Vault, providing hierarchical configuration storage (tenant → environment → application → organization) with schema-based validation and automatic secret separation. Built REST APIs for configuration CRUD operations, preference management, and config format conversion, integrated circuit breaker pattern for resilience, and deployed on Kubernetes achieving sub-100ms response times and 99.9% availability.

---

## Option 2: Impact-Focused

Architected and developed a centralized configuration and secrets management system using Java 17, Spring Boot, Consul, and HashiCorp Vault, enabling hierarchical multi-tenant configuration storage with automatic secret extraction and secure Vault integration. Delivered REST APIs with schema validation, preference management, and config merging capabilities, deployed on Kubernetes processing thousands of requests per second with sub-100ms latency and 99.9% uptime.

## Option 3: Feature-Rich

Built a production-grade configuration and secrets management platform using Java 17, Spring Boot 3.3.11, Consul, and HashiCorp Vault, supporting hierarchical configurations (tenant/environment/app/org), schema-based validation, automatic secret separation, and preference management. Implemented REST APIs with circuit breaker resilience, config reference resolution, format conversion (JSON to properties), and deployed on Kubernetes with comprehensive monitoring achieving sub-100ms response times.
