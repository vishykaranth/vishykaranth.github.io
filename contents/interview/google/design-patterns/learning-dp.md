  > Design patterns are key to good PHP programming, and a fundamental to anyone wanting to learn PHP and become a better programmer. Design patterns are solutions for common problems that people have discovered and documented, so you don't have to re-invent the wheel every time you run into one of these problems on your next software engineering project.

- [ ] [Design Patterns](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns) - SourceMaking.com, detailed articles on code examples are given in Java, C++, PHP and Python
  > In software engineering, a design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. A design pattern isn't a finished design that can be transformed directly into code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.
  - [Creational patterns](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/creational_patterns) - 6 patterns (Abstract Factory, Builder, Factory Method, Object Pool, Prototype and Singleton)
    > In software engineering, creational design patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation.
  - [Structural patterns](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/structural_patterns) - 8 patterns (Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Private Class Data and Proxy)
    > In Software Engineering, Structural Design Patterns are Design Patterns that ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships between entities.
  - [Behavioral patterns](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/behavioral_patterns) - 11 patterns (Chain of responsibility, Command, Interpreter, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Null Object, Observer, State, Strategy, Template method, Visitor)
    > In software engineering, behavioral design patterns are design patterns that identify common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns. By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out this communication.
- [x] [Design Patterns](https://phptherightway.com/pages/Design-Patterns.html) - PHPTheRightWay.com (Factory, Singleton, Strategy, Front Controller, Model-View-Controller)
  > There are numerous ways to structure the code and project for your web application, and you can put as much or as little thought as you like into architecting. But it is usually a good idea to follow common patterns because it will make your code easier to manage and easier for others to understand.

### [<a name='Principles'></a>Principles of Good Design

- [x] [SOLID principles of object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) - wikipedia (2-3 minutes)
  > SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible and maintainable.
  - Single responsibility principle
    - A class should only have a single responsibility, that is, only changes to one part of the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class.
  - Openâ€“closed principle
    - "Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."
  - Liskov substitution principle
    - "Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program." See also design by contract.
  - Interface segregation principle
    - "Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface."
  - Dependency inversion principle
    - One should "depend upon abstractions, \[not\] concretions."
- [x] [GRASP (object-oriented design)](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRASP_(object-oriented_design)>) - wikipedia (6-8 minutes)
  > General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns (or Principles), abbreviated GRASP, consist of guidelines for assigning responsibility to classes and objects in object-oriented design.
  > The different patterns and principles used in GRASP are controller, creator, indirection, information expert, high cohesion, low coupling, polymorphism, protected variations, and pure fabrication.
- [x] [KISS principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) - wikipedia (5-6 minutes)
  > KISS, an acronym for "keep it simple, stupid"
- [x] [Don't repeat yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) - wikipedia (3-4 minutes)
  > DRY is a principle of software development aimed at reducing repetition of software patterns, replacing it with abstractions or using data normalization to avoid redundancy.
- [x] [Software design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern) - wikipedia (25-32 minutes)
  > In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. Design patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.

### <a name='Tips'></a>Tips for Learning

> Start shallow and broad. Skim as many as you can at the beginning. When you know what they do go deeper, only if you need to. - Smok

My take on this is to learn the different patterns, where they would be used, but do not memorise how to program every one. Once code is refactored and a pattern identified, then use the examples from above to implement the exact programming pattern.

> I think the problem with patterns is that often people do know them but don't know when to apply which. - Dominik Liebler (DesignPatternsPHP)

My take is the patterns need to be known and what context they are best used for.
