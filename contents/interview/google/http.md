## HTTP 
- Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-layer protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. 
- HTTP was designed for communication between web browsers and web servers, but it can also be used for other purposes. 
- HTTP follows a classical client-server model, with a client opening a connection to make a request, then waiting until it receives a response. 
- HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning that the server does not keep any data (state) between two requests. 
- Though often based on a TCP/IP layer, it can be used on any reliable transport layer, that is, a protocol that doesn't lose messages silently like UDP does. 
- RUDP — the reliable update of UDP — is a suitable alternative.

## An overview of HTTP
- HTTP is a protocol which allows the fetching of resources, such as HTML documents. 
- HTTP is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and it is a client-server protocol, which means requests are initiated by the recipient, usually the Web browser. 
- A complete document is reconstructed from the different sub-documents fetched, for instance text, layout description, images, videos, scripts, and more.
