## Chapter 1
- Spring Boot brings a great deal of magic to Spring application development. 
- But there are four core tricks that it performs:
    - Automatic configuration—Spring Boot can automatically provide configuration for application functionality common to many Spring applications.
    - Starter dependencies—You tell Spring Boot what kind of functionality you need, and it will ensure that the libraries needed are added to the build.
    - The command-line interface—This optional feature of Spring Boot lets you write complete applications with just application code, but no need for a traditional project build.
    - The Actuator—Gives you insight into what’s going on inside of a running Spring Boot application.
