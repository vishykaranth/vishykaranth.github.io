## Interview Pointers 
- The details aren't always there (ask questions in an Interview)
- Working Code ISN'T everything (improve your efficiency)
- Your code isn't evaluated, YOU ARE! (think out loud)
- Focusing on things that don't matter (don't worry about comparative statistics on Leetcode)
- Not practicing in the right setting (practice without autocomplete/syntax highlighting using a whiteboard/pen-paper)
- Aspects like how you communicate, listen and respond to things matter as much as your coding skills
- Before jumping into solution you can explain your approach. You can get all clarifications at this point. 
- You may not need to write sort code( or custom code) every time - before writing check with interviewer whether you can use standard library.
- If you forget some syntax or stuck at some point don't be down, speak out. This is also a way to find team players.
- If you are not getting an algorithm with nlogn or n complexity, don't worry start with exponential time complexity algorithm and optimise it in second iteration.
