##Write secrets
- Now that the dev server is up and running, let's get straight to it and read and write our first secret.
- Login with root token.
    - vault login root
- Let's start by writing a secret. This is done very simply with the vault kv command, as shown below:
    - vault kv put secret/hello foo=world
- This writes the pair foo=world to the path secret/hello. 
    - For now, it is important that the path is prefixed with secret/, otherwise this example won't work. 
    - The secret/ prefix is where arbitrary secrets can be read and written.
- You can even write multiple pieces of data, if you want:
    - vault kv put secret/hello foo=world excited=yes
    - vault kv put is a very powerful command. In addition to writing data directly from the command-line, it can read values and key pairs from STDIN as well as files. For more information, see the command documentation.
    - Warning: The documentation uses the key=value based entry throughout, but it is more secure to use files if possible. 
    - Sending data via the CLI is often logged in shell history. 
    - For real secrets, please use files. 
- Getting a Secret
- As you might expect, secrets can be gotten with vault get:
    - vault kv get secret/hello
- As you can see, the values we wrote are given back to us. Vault gets the data from storage and decrypts it.
- The output format is purposefully whitespace separated to make it easy to pipe into a tool like awk.
- This contains some extra information. Many secrets engines create leases for secrets that allow time-limited access to other systems, and in those cases lease_id would contain a lease identifier and lease_duration would contain the length of time for which the lease is valid, in seconds.
- To print only the value of a given field:
    - vault kv get -field=excited secret/hello
- Optional JSON output is very useful for scripts. For example below we use the jq tool to extract the value of the excited secret:
    - vault kv get -format=json secret/hello | jq -r .data.data.excited
- Deleting a Secret
    - vault kv delete secret/hello
