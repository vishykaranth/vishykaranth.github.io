##Characteristics of Servant Leaders
### Listening. 
- Leaders traditionally have been valued for their communication and decision-making skills. 
- Although these are also important skills for the servant leader, they need to be reinforced by a deep commitment to listening intently to others. 
- The servant leader seeks to identify the will of a group and helps to clarify that will. 
- He or she listens receptively to what is being said and not said. 
- Listening also encompasses hearing one’s own inner voice. 
- Listening, coupled with periods of reflection, is essential to the growth and well-being of the servant leader.

### Empathy. 
- The servant leader strives to understand and empathize with others.
- People deserve to be accepted and recognized for their special and unique spirits.
- One assumes the good intentions of coworkers and colleagues and does not reject them as people, even when one may be forced to refuse to accept certain behaviors or performance.
- The most successful servant leaders are those who have become skilled empathetic listeners.

### Healing. 
- The healing of relationships is a powerful force for transformation and integration.
- One of the great strengths of servant leadership is the potential for healing one’s self and one’s relationship to others.
- Many people have broken spirits and have suffered from a variety of emotional hurts.
- Although this is a part of being human, servant leaders recognize that they have an opportunity to help make whole those with whom they come in contact.
- There is something subtle communicated to one who is being served and led if, 
    - implicit in the compact between servant leader and led, 
    - is the understanding that the search for wholeness is something they share.

### Awareness. 
- General awareness, and especially self-awareness, strengthens the servant leader.
- Awareness helps one in understanding issues involving ethics, power, and values.
- It lends itself to being able to view most situations from a more integrated, holistic position.
- Awareness is not a giver of solace—it is just the opposite.
- It is a disturber and an awakener.
- Able leaders are usually sharply awake and reasonably disturbed.
- They are not seekers after solace.
- They have their own inner serenity.

### Persuasion. 
- Another characteristic of servant leaders is reliance on persuasion, rather than on one’s positional authority, in making decisions within an organization.
- The servant leader seeks to convince others, rather than coerce compliance.
- This particular element offers one of the clearest distinctions between the traditional authoritarian model and that of servant leadership.
- The servant leader is effective at building consensus within groups.

### Conceptualization. 
- Servant leaders seek to nurture their abilities to dream great dreams.
- The ability to look at a problem or an organization from a conceptualizing perspective means that one must think beyond day-to-day realities.
- For many leaders, this is a characteristic that requires discipline and practice.
- The traditional leader is consumed by the need to achieve short-term operational goals.
- The leader who wishes also to be a servant leader must stretch his or her thinking to encompass broader-based conceptual thinking.
- Within organizations, conceptualization is, by its very nature, a key role of boards of trustees or directors.
- Unfortunately, boards can sometimes become involved in the day-to-day operations—
    - something that should always be discouraged—
    - and thus fail to provide the visionary concept for an institution.
- Trustees need to be mostly conceptual in their orientation; 
    - staffs need to be mostly operational in their perspective; 
    - and the most effective executive leaders probably need to develop both perspectives within themselves.
- Servant leaders are called to seek a delicate balance between conceptual thinking and a day-to-day operational approach.

### Foresight. 
- Closely related to conceptualization, the ability to foresee the likely outcome of a situation is hard to define but easier to identify.
- One knows foresight when one experiences it.
- Foresight is a characteristic that enables the servant leader to understand the lessons from the past, the realities of the present, and the likely consequence of a decision for the future.
- It is also deeply rooted within the intuitive mind.
- Foresight remains a largely unexplored area in leadership studies, but it is one most deserving of careful attention.

### Stewardship. 
- Servant leadership, like stewardship, assumes a commitment to serving the needs of others.
- It also emphasizes the use of openness and persuasion rather than control.

### Commitment to the growth of people. 
- Servant leaders believe that people have an intrinsic value beyond their tangible contributions as workers. 
- As such, the servant leader is deeply committed to the growth of each individual within his or her organization. 
- The servant leader recognizes the tremendous responsibility to do everything in his or her power to nurture the personal and professional growth of employees and colleagues. 
- In practice, this can include concrete actions such as making funds available for personal and professional development, 
    - taking a personal interest in the ideas and suggestions from everyone, 
    - encouraging worker involvement in decision making, 
    - and actively assisting laid-off employees to find other positions.

### Building community. 
- The servant leader senses that much has been lost in recent human history as a result of the shift from local communities to large institutions as the primary shaper of human lives. 
- This awareness causes the servant leader to seek to identify some means for building community among those who work within a given institution. 
- Servant leadership suggests that true community can be created among those who work in businesses and other institutions. 
- Greenleaf said, “
    - All that is needed to rebuild community as a viable life form for large numbers of people is for enough servant leaders to show the way, 
    - not by mass movements, but by each servant leader demonstrating his or her unlimited liability for a quite specific community-related group.”
- These ten characteristics of servant leadership are by no means exhaustive. 
- However, they do serve to communicate the power and promise that this concept offers to those who are open to its invitation and challenge.
- We are experiencing a rapid shift in many businesses and not-for-profit organizations—away from the more traditional autocratic 
- and hierarchical models of leadership and toward servant leadership as a way of being in relationship with others. 
- Interest in the meaning and practice of servant leadership continues to grow. 
- Many books, articles, and papers on the subject have now been published. Workshops, courses, and degrees in servant leadership are now available. 
- Many of the companies named to Fortune magazine’s annual listing of “The 100 Best Companies to Work For” espouse servant leadership and have integrated it into their corporate cultures. 
- My own work in servant leadership over the past quarter century has brought me into direct or indirect contact with millions of people who embrace servant leadership, 
- and who are now working to create servant-led organizations of all kinds.
- Servant leadership characteristics often occur naturally within many individuals and, like many natural tendencies, they can be enhanced through learning and practice. 
- Servant leadership offers great hope for the future in creating better, more caring, institutions.
