## System Design Basics
- Whenever we are designing a large system, we need to consider few things:
    - What are different architectural pieces that can be used?
    - How do these pieces work with each other?
    - How can we best utilize these pieces, what are the right tradeoffs?
- Investing in scaling before it is needed is generally not a smart business proposition; however, some forethought into the design can save valuable time and resources in the future. 
- System Design aspects are,
    - core building blocks of scalable systems. 
    - distributed system concepts. 
    - Consistent Hashing, 
    - CAP Theorem, 
    - Load Balancing, 
    - Caching, 
    - Data Partitioning, 
    - Indexes, 
    - Proxies, 
    - Queues, 
    - Replication
    - choosing between SQL vs. NoSQL.
