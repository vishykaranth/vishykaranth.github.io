## Clones 
- Public servers of a scalable web service are hidden behind a load balancer.
- This load balancer evenly distributes load (requests from your users) onto your group/cluster of  application servers.
- That means that if, for example, user Steve interacts with your service, 
    - he may be served at his first request by server 2, 
    - then with his second request by server 9 and then maybe again by server 2 on his third request. 
- Steve should always get the same results of his request back, independent what server he  “landed on”.
- That leads to the first golden rule for scalability: 
    - every server contains exactly the same codebase 
    - and does not store any user-related data, 
        - like sessions or profile pictures, on local disc or memory. 
- Sessions need to be stored in a centralized data store which is accessible to all your application servers. 
- It can be an external database or an external persistent cache, like Redis. 
    - An external persistent cache will have better performance than an external database. 
    - By external I mean that the data store does not reside on the application servers. 
    - Instead, it is somewhere in or near the data center of your application servers.  
- But what about deployment? 
    - How can you make sure that a code change is sent to all your servers without one server still serving old code? 
- After “outsourcing” your sessions and serving the same codebase from all your servers, 
    - you can now create an image file from one of these servers (AWS calls this AMI - Amazon Machine Image.) 
    - Use this AMI as a “super-clone” that all your new instances are based upon.
    - Whenever you start a new instance/clone, just do an initial deployment of your latest code and you are ready!.
