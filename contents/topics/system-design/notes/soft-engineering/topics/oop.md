# OOP

- Encapsulation – an object contains (encapsulates) both (1) data and (2) the relevant processing instructions, as we have seen. Once an object has been created, it can be reused in other programs.
- Inheritance – once you have created an object, you can use it as the foundation for similar objects that have the same behavior and characteristics.
- Polymorphism – generics, the presence of "many shapes." In object-oriented programming, polymorphism means that a message (generalized request) produces different results based on the object that it is sent to.
