# Introduction For Interview
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzLMhqg3_Wc) - Video tutorial by Tushar Roy

## Things to do
- Ask good questions
  - What features to work on
  - How much to scale
- Don't use buzzwords
- Clear and organized thinking
- Drive discussions (80-20 rule)

## Things to consider
- Features
- Define APIs
- Availability
  - What if something goes down
- Latency Performace
  - Cache
- Scalability
- Durability
  - Data stored securely
  - Not lost
  - Not compromised
  - Matter in some interviews
- Class Diagram
  - OO Priciples
- Security & Privacy
- Cost effective

## Concepts
- Vertical & Horizontal scaling
  - Vertical - Cap at how much for 1 host
  - Horizontal - Infinite add more hosts
    - Has to deal with distributed system challenges
    - Preferred over vertical
- CAP Theorem
  - Consistency - read has most recent write
  - Availability - get data back irregardless of most recent or not
  - Partition Tolerance - bw 2 nodes packets could be dropped
  - Only achieve 2/3
  - Traditional Consistency > Availability
  - NoSQL Availability > Consistency
- ACID - Atomic Consistent Isolated Durable
  - Relational
- BASE - Basic Availability Soft-State Eventual consistency
  - NoSQL
  - If use NoSQL know which part of ACID sacrifice
- Partitioning / Sharding Data
  - Store in different servers
  - **Consistent Hashing**
- Optimistic vs Pessimistic Locking
- Strong vs Eventual consistency
  - Strong - always see latest write
    - Relation more
  - Eventual - see some, eventually will see latest
    - NoSQL, can choose
    - Higher availability
- RelationalDB vs NoSQL
  - rDB - ACID
  - NoSQL - Scales better, better availability
- Types of NoSQL
  - Key Value
  - Wide Column
  - Document Based
    - Semi-structured
    - XML, JSON
  - Graph Based
- Caching
  1. Every node does own cache
  2. Distributed cache - sharing
  - Considerations
    - Cache cannot be source of truth
    - Small - in memory
    - Eviction policy? around cache
- Data center / Racks / hosts
  - Latency cross hosts, DC
- CPU/Memory/HD/Bandwidth
  - Limited resources
- Ramdom vs sequential read/write on disk
  - Design around sequential since faster
- HTTP vs HTTP2 vs websockets
  - HTTP2 improve
    - Multiple requests or single
  - websocket - fully bidirectional communication
- TCP/IP Model
- IPV4 vs IPV6
  - ipv4 = 32 bit addresses
  - ipv6 = 128 bit addresses
- TCP vs UDP
  - TCP - reliable
    - documents
  - UDP - unreliable
    - Faster
    - Video
- DNS Lookup
  - Translate address -> ip address
  - Caching
- HTTPS & TLS
- Public key infrastructure & certificate authority
- symmetric vs asymmetric encryption
  - asymmetric - private / public encryption
    - More computation so better for smaller data
  - symmetric - AES
- Load Balancer
  - Sit in front service and delegate to node behind server
  - Round Robin or load average
  - L4
    - Both client and destination & port
  - L7
    - HTTP URI for routing
- CDNs & Edge
  - Content Delivery Network
    - Data close to streaming point
    - Improve performance and latency
  - Edge
    - Processing close to end-user
- Bloom Filters & Count-min sketch
  - Bloom Filters
    - Determine if element is part of set
    - False positives but never false negatives
    - Space efficient
  - Count-min sketch
    - Count frequency of events
    - Close to answer w/ some error rate
- Paxos - Consensus over distributed hosts
  - Paxos solve: Leader election amonst hosts
- Design Patterns & OO
- Virtual Machines & Containers
  - containers - run application & dependencies in isolated env.
- Publishers-Subscribers over Queue
  - Publish -> Queue -> Subscriber
  - Customer facing should not expose to PubSub system
- MapReduce
  - Distributed mass parallel big data
  - Map - filtering and sort
  - Reduce - Summarizing data
- Multithreading, concurrency, locks, synchronization, CAS

    - Java based
    - Distributed & fault tolerant
  - Hadoop relies on HDFS for processing
