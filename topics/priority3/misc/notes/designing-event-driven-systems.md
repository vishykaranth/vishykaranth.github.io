## designing-event-driven-systems

### High Level 
- Part I 
    - sets the scene, with chapters that introduce Kafka and stream processing and 
    - should provide even seasoned practitioners with a useful overview of the base concepts. 
- Part II 
	- youâ€™ll find out how to build event-driven systems, 
	- how such systems relate to stateful stream processing, and 
	- how to apply patterns like Event Collaboration, Event Sourcing, and CQRS. 
- Part III 
    - is more conceptual, 
    - building on the ideas from Part II, 
    - but applying them at the level of whole organizations. 
    - Here we question many of the common approaches used today, and 
    - dig into patterns like event streams as a source of truth. 
- Part IV and Part V are more practical. 
- Part V starts to dip into a little code, and 
    - there is an associated GitHub project to help you get started if you want to build fine-grained services with Kafka Streams.
    - The introduction given in Chapter 1 provides a high-level overview of the main concepts covered in this book, so it is a good place to start.
