### Event Sourcing

- As Event Sourcing (ES) becomes more and more mainstream, usually bundled with DDD and CQRS, 
    - it's important for domain modellers, application architects etc to understand the paradigm behind the recipe.
- In the 'classical' approach, the domain state is seen as a data structure or a collection of data structures (entities data). 
- In ES we see the domain state as a collection of changes. 
- If you're familiar with accounting or at least basic book-keeping, you know that (before computers) a book-keeper would write the daily relevant financial transactions into a ledger. 
    - Using their accounting 'language' they would record all the business events as they were.
- An important thing here is that a book-keeper just writes down things, there's no attempt at interpreting or processing the events. 
    - Basically, a financially specialized scribe keeping a log of business actions.
- When an investor or a manager wants to asses the health of the company, they usually look at 3 documents: balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement. 
    - Each report offers a different view of the business highlighting different aspects. 
- Well, someone (these days a software) would look at all transactions recorded in the general ledger and depending on what report is generated, specific information is extracted and aggregated according to that report's purpose.
- By now, you've probably noticed that the ledger is basically an Event Store and that accounting is using CQRS (imagine that!!). 
    - So, we can say that ES is the book-keeping approach adapted for software development. 
    - A paradigm that has been used in any business in the world for hundreds of years. 
    - And if it works very well in the real world, it should work very well in a Domain Driven application, too.
- The ES mindset sees the domain state as the accounting ledger (incidentally the Event Store is the actual 'ledger' as a technical detail), 
    - a collection of business actions that already happened (events). 
    - Like the book-keeper, we want to record operations and not just update some data structures like in the classical approach. 
    - Therefore properly identifying relevant domain events becomes very important and it's the first step when applying ES.
- At this point you might wonder:"Okay, but what's wrong with the old approach?". 
    - In the end it's easier just to modify some data structure. 
    - It is, but it's also limited, because 
        - 1) all you have is the most current data and 
        - 2) accounting proved that recording operations instead of just modifying existing data is more flexible. 
        - Why reinvent the wheel poorly, when we have a hundreds of years old approach that works very well?!
- Remember, in accounting, all events are written once then we can get any type of report based on that information. In ES we call those reports projections.
- Now, let's say I need the state of some entity. Since all we have is a collection of operations that happened (grouped by entity), we need to process (apply) the relevant events in a manner that makes sense for the business use case needing that state. 
    - This means that the events are 'processed' in order to extract the relevant information, so we can say that restoring an entity state is a form of creating a report. 
    - That's why, the resulted state should be considered a read model from CQRS point of view. 
    - Obviously, actual code implementations may vary depending on your style.
- And speaking of restoring state or any other projection, the fact that it's based on the collection of events makes it event sourced, hence the name of the pattern.
- Once you understand that, in the design process, we're focusing on the outcomes of business operations a.k.a domain events, 
    - that are persisted as they are, 
    - then projected (processed) according to reporting needs, 
    - you know the essence of ES.
