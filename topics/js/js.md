- JavaScript is an important language because it is the language of the web browser. 
- Its association with the browser makes it one of the most popular programming languages in the world. 
- The API of the browser, the Document Object Model (DOM) is quite awful, and JavaScript is unfairly blamed. 
    - The DOM would be painful to work with in any language. 
    - The DOM is poorly specified and inconsistently implemented.
- With JavaScript it is possible to get work done with it without knowing much about the language, or even knowing much about programming.
    - It is a language with enormous expressive power. 
    - It is even better when you know what you’re doing. 
    - Programming is difficult business. It should never be undertaken in ignorance.
- The very good ideas include functions, loose typing, dynamic objects, and an expressive object literal notation. 
- The bad ideas include a programming model based on global variables.    
- JavaScript’s functions are first class objects with (mostly) lexical scoping
- JavaScript is the first lambda language to go mainstream.
- Deep down, JavaScript has more in common with Lisp and Scheme than with Java. 
    - It is Lisp in C’s clothing. This makes JavaScript a remarkably powerful language.
- JavaScript is a loosely typed language, so JavaScript compilers are unable to detect type errors.
- JavaScript has a very powerful object literal notation.
- This notation was the inspiration for JSON, the popular data interchange format.
- A controversial feature in JavaScript is prototypal inheritance. 
    - JavaScript has a classfree object system in which objects inherit properties directly from other objects. 
    - if you learn to work with JavaScript’s prototypal nature, your efforts will be rewarded.
- JavaScript depends on global variables for linkage. 
    - All of the top-level variables of all compilation units are tossed together in a common namespace called the global object. 
    - This is a bad thing because global variables are evil, and in JavaScript they are fundamental.
