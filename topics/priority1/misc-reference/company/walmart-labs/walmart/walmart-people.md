### 5 Principles of Teamwork
- Principle #1: Division of Labor
    - Division of labor is about role clarity and how your contributions align with the goals set by the team to ensure its success.
    - As an individual on a team, 
        - it is important you take time to self-reflect, 
        - understand your weaknesses, 
        - invest in your strengths, 
        - and leverage your talents towards the success of the team.
    - As a manager of a team, 
        - it is important you understand the strengths of each member, 
        - place them in positions to be successful, 
        - and clearly communicate their role within the team so there is a consistent understanding of the division of labor.
    - Doing these things will put you on a fast track to operational efficiency.
- Principle #2: Communication
    - Encourage in-person meetings or if using web conference software, ensure everyone has their video camera on
    - Be open minded: practice positive intent, active listening and empathy
    - Get the team together for events outside of work (i.e., happy hour, quarterly team activities)
- Principle #3: Collaboration
    - Are you willing to work with others with an open mind to new ideas or approaches?
    - Do you know and trust the members of your team?
    - Are you aware of each team member’s role and the benefit they bring?
    - Are you willing to help a struggling team member for the success of the team?     
- Principle #4: Conflict Resolution
    - Align on team processes and standards to ensure operational consistency
    - Encourage fact-based decision-making to remove emotion and personal attachment
    - Remove the “I” from the equation. Challenge the cost benefit by identifying what is right for the customer, company, and/or team
    - Provide real-time feedback addressing issues up-front instead of allowing resentment to build
- Principle #5: Support
    - Building a strong team culture takes patience and discipline. 
    - The principles above can help lay a solid foundation, but to tie it all together the final principle of Support is required.
    - As a leader, whether people-manager or individual contributor, ask yourself, this question:
        - “What is my role in supporting the team?” 
        - Remember — it only takes one person to make a difference.
- Wrapping Up
    - Ants have an instinctual understanding that the colony needs to work together in order to be successful. 
    - Use the principles below as a guide to help create a support system for a strong team culture:
    - Clear division of labor and role definitions within your team
    - Align on a set of communication best practices understood by all members of the team
    - Create a work environment built on trust and empathy
    - Manage healthy conflict through standards, processes, and real-time feedback
    - Develop a support system through patience and discipline 
    - “Coming together is a beginning. Keeping together is progress. Working together is success.” -Henry            

## Are You An Effective Delegator 
- Do you find yourself stressed out, spending extra hours accomplishing routine tasks?
    - How often do you feel others don’t take ownership of their work and you need to step in and pick up the slack?
- Do you find yourself consistently missing deadlines or producing mediocre results?
    - How often do you find yourself “trying to do it all” only to fall short in the end?
- Do you find yourself micro-managing others or feel they are not capable of doing the task?
    - How often do you feel it’s easier to do the task yourself rather than trusting others for help?

        - Do’s and Don’ts
            - Do: Provide clarity on why the task is important
            - Don’t: Expect people to read your mind
            - Do: Align on a due date for completing the task
            - Don’t: Delegate without an end date in mind

- The art of delegation is a journey. 
    - Remember to be self-aware, avoiding excessive criticism of others or of situations, while communicating continuously providing clear direction and guidance. 
- The Benefits of Delegation
    - Delegate work to team members whose skills are better suited for the task. 
    - This will keep the team productive, giving you time to focus on planning and strategizing for the future.
    - Encourage team members to become experts, even if that means they may surpass your abilities. 
    - Not only will this strengthen the relationship between leader and team member, it ensures the overall success of the team
    - Invest in your team members through coaching and mentorship helping them learn new skills, then delegate tasks so they use those new skills. 
    - This will encourage them to take a personal interest in their own development to learn and grow.  
- Delegate like a Pro by Mastering these Techniques
    - Level 1: Look into this problem. Give me all the facts. I will decide what to do.
    - Level 2: Let me know the options available with the pros and cons of each. I will decide what to select.
    - Level 3: Let me know the criteria for your recommendation, which alternatives you have identified and which one appears best to you with any risk identified.I will make the decision.
    - Level 4: Recommend a course of action for my approval.
    - Level 5: Let me know what you intend to do. Delay action until I approve.
    - Level 6: Let me know what you intend to do. Do it unless I say not to.
    - Level 7: Take action. Let me know what you did. Let me know how it turns out.
    - Level 8: Take action. Communicate with me only if the action is unsuccessful.
    - Level 9: Take action. No further communication with me is necessary.
- Tip: It’s a good idea to practice using the different levels of delegation so you become familiar with the type of language needed for each and are able to use them interchangeably. 
- Doing so will enable you to adapt your style to fit the situation and person to whom you are delegating to.
