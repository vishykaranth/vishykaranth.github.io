## System Design 

### Approach
- Ask as many questions as possible to get a clear understanding of the requirements.
- Write them down the main use cases on the whiteboard.
- Ask re-clarifying and scope related questions.
- Once you have the requirements written down draw up a flow diagram with various components and how they are connected and talk about the possible use cases.
- Think out loud. Verify your assumptions with the interviewer.
- Be prepared to write up the APIs specs for the flows and split the applications down by features.
- Also, you would need to have a fair understanding of various types of databases. When do you use RDBMS vs NoSQL? When do you use a message queue? Which type of queue would you use?
- Detailing what kind of cache you would use and where.
- Talk about scaling, Redundancy, DR.

### Examples 
- Design a URL shortening service like bit.ly.
- How would you implement the Google search?
- Design a client-server application which allows people to play chess with one another.
- How would you store the relations in a social network like Facebook and implement a feature where one user receives notifications when their friends like the same things as they do?
