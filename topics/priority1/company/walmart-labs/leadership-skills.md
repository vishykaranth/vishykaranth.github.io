## Top 10 Leadership Qualities That Make Good Leaders

### Honesty and Integrity
- “The supreme quality of leadership is unquestionably integrity." 
    - Honesty and integrity are two important ingredients which make a good leader. 
    - How can you expect your followers to be honest when you lack these qualities yourself? 
    - Leaders succeed when they stick to their values and core beliefs and without ethics, this will not be possible.

### Confidence
- To be an effective leader, you should be confident enough to ensure that other follow your commands. 
- If you are unsure about your own decisions and qualities, then your subordinates will never follow you. 
- As a leader, you have to be oozing with confidence, show some swagger and assertiveness to gain the respect of your subordinates. 
- This does not mean that you should be overconfident, but you should at least reflect the degree of confidence required to ensure that your followers trust you as a leader.

### Inspire Others
- Probably the most difficult job for a leader is to persuade others to follow. 
- It can only be possible if you inspire your followers by setting a good example. 
- When the going gets tough, they look up to you and see how you react to the situation. 
- If you handle it well, they will follow you. 
- As a leader, should think positive and this positive approach should be visible through your actions. 
- Stay calm under pressure and keep the motivation level up. 
- As John Quincy Adams puts it, “If your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, you are a leader.” 
- If you are successful in inspiring your subordinates, you can easily overcome any current and future challenge easily.

### Commitment and Passion
- Your teams look up to you and if you want them to give them their all, you will have to be passionate about it too. 
- When your teammates see you getting your hands dirty, they will also give their best shot. 
- It will also help you to gain the respect of your subordinates and infuse new energy in your team members, which helps them to perform better. 
- If they feel that you are not fully committed or lacks passion, then it would be an uphill task for the leader to motivate your followers to achieve the goal.

### Good Communicator
- Good Communicator - Until you clearly communicate your vision to your team and tell them the strategy to achieve the goal, 
    - it will be very difficult for you to get the results you want. 
- Simply put, if you are unable to communicate your message effectively to your team, you can never be a good leader. 
- A good communicator can be a good leader. 
- Words have the power to motivate people and make them do the unthinkable. 
- If you use them effectively, you can also achieve better results.
- As a leader, you need to be able to clearly and succinctly explain to your employees everything from organizational goals to specific tasks. 
- Leaders must master all forms of communication, including one-on-one, departmental, and full-staff conversations, as well as communication via the phone, email, and social media.
- A large part of communication involves listening. 
- Therefore, leaders should establish a steady flow of communication between themselves and their staff or team members, either through an open-door policy or regular conversations with workers. 
- Leaders should make themselves regularly available to discuss issues and concerns with employees. 
- Other skills related to communication include:
    - Active listening
    - Articulating
    - Business storytelling
    - Clarity
    - Concision
    - Correspondence
    - Editing
    - Explaining
    - Expression
    - Facilitating group conversations
    - Nonverbal communication
    - Presentation
    - Public speaking
    - Reading body language
    - Reducing ambiguity
    - Verbal communication
    - Written communication

### Decision-Making Capabilities
- Apart from having a futuristic vision, a leader should have the ability to take the right decision at the right time. 
- Decisions taken by leaders have a profound impact on masses. 
- A leader should think long and hard before taking a decision but once the decision is taken, stand by it. 
- Although, most leaders take decisions on their own, but it is highly recommended that you consult key stakeholders before taking a decision. 
- After all, they are the ones who will benefit or suffer from your decisions.

### Accountability
- “A good leader takes little more than his share of the blame and little less than his share of the credit.” 
- Make sure that every one of your subordinates is accountable for what they are doing. 
- If they do well, give them a pat on the back but if they struggle, make them realize their mistakes and work together to improve. 
- Holding them accountable for their actions will create a sense of responsibility among your subordinates and they will go about the business more seriously.

### Delegation and Empowerment
- Delegation and Empowerment - You cannot do everything, right. 
- It is important for a leader to focus on key responsibilities while leaving the rest to others. 
- By that, I mean empowering your followers and delegating tasks to them. 
- If you continue to micromanage your subordinates, 
    - it will develop a lack of trust and more importantly, 
    - you will not be able to focus on important matters, as you should be. 
- Delegate tasks to your subordinates and see how they perform. 
- Provide them with all the resources and support they need to achieve the objective and give them a chance to bear the responsibility.

### Creativity and Innovation
- What separates a leader from a follower? 
- Steve Jobs, the greatest visionary of our time answers this question this way, “Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower.” 
- In order to get ahead in today’s fast-paced world, a leader must be creative and innovative at the same time. 
- Creative thinking and constant innovation is what makes you and your team stand out from the crowd. 
- Think out of the box to come up with unique ideas and turn those ideas and goals into reality.

### Empathy
- Last but certainly not the least, is empathy. 
- Leaders should develop empathy with their followers. 
- Unfortunately, most leaders follow a dictatorial style and neglect empathy altogether. 
- Due to this, they fail to make a closer connection with their followers. 
- Understanding the problems of your followers and feeling their pain is the first step to become an effective leader. 
- Even that is not enough until you work hard and provide your followers with the suitable solution to their problems.

### Motivation
- Leaders need to inspire their workers to go the extra mile for their organizations; just paying a fair salary to employees is typically not enough inspiration (although it is important too). There are a number of ways to motivate your workers: you may build employee self-esteem through recognition and rewards, or by giving employees new responsibilities to increase their investment in the company.
- Leaders must learn what motivators work best for their employees or team members to encourage productivity and passion. Skills related to effective motivation include:
    - Allowing employee autonomy
    - Asking for input
    - Assessing the interests of staff
    - Convincing
    - Mentoring
    - Open to employee concerns
    - Persuasive
    - Providing productive and challenging work
    - Providing rewards
    - Recognizing others
    - Setting effective goals
    - Team-building
    - Thanking staff
    - Understanding employee differences

### Delegating
- Leaders who try to take on too many tasks by themselves will struggle to get anything done. These leaders often fear that delegating tasks is a sign of weakness, when in fact it is a sign of a strong leader.
- Therefore, you need to identify the skills of each of your employees, and assign duties to each employee based on his or her skill set. By delegating tasks to staff members, you can focus on other important tasks. Some skills that make a good delegator include:
	- Accepting feedback from employees
	- Allotting resources for employees
	- Assessing employee strengths and weaknesses
	- Defining expectations
	- Evaluating employee performance
	- Identifying measurable outcomes
	- Matching the task to the right employee
	- Prioritizing tasks
	- Setting expectations
	- Teamwork
	- Time management
	- Training
	- Trust in employees
### Positivity
- A positive attitude can go a long way in an office. You should be able to laugh at yourself when something doesn't go quite as planned; this helps create a happy and healthy work environment, even during busy, stressful periods.
- Simple acts like asking employees about their vacation plans will develop a positive atmosphere in the office, and raise morale among staff members.
- If employees feel that they work in a positive environment, they will be more likely to want to be at work, and will therefore be more willing to put in the long hours when needed. Some skills that help make for a positive atmosphere in the workplace include:
	- Caring
	- Conflict management
	- Developing rapport
	- Diplomacy
	- Encouraging
	- Empathetic
	- Friendliness
	- Helping others
	- Humor
	- Interpersonal
	- Positive reinforcement
	- Respect
	- Social
### Trustworthiness
- Employees need to be able to feel comfortable coming to their manager or leader with questions and concerns. It is important for you to demonstrate your integrity – employees will only trust leaders they respect.
- By being open and honest, you will encourage the same sort of honesty in your employees. Here are some skills and qualities that will help you convey your trustworthiness as a leader:
    - Ability to apologize
    - Accountability

### Creativity
- As a leader, you have to make a number of decisions that do not have a clear answer; you therefore need to be able to think outside of the box.
- Learning to try nontraditional solutions, or approaching problems in nontraditional ways, will help you to solve an otherwise unsolvable problem. Most employees will also be impressed and inspired by a leader who doesn't always choose the safe, conventional path. Here are some skills related to creative thinking:
    - Analytical
    - Cognitive flexibility

    - Open-mindedness
    - Problem solving
    - Sound judgment
    - Synthesizing

### Feedback
- Leaders should constantly look for opportunities to deliver useful information to team members about their performance. However, there is a fine line between offering employees advice and assistance, and micromanaging. By teaching employees how to improve their work and make their own decisions, you will feel more confident delegating tasks to your staff.
- Employees will also respect a leader who provides feedback in a clear but empathetic way. Some skills for giving clear feedback include:
    - Being open to receiving feedback
    - Building confidence in employees
    - Clarity
    - Clearly laying out expectations

    - Mentoring
    - Positive reinforcement
    - Providing specific advice
    - Respectful
### Responsibility
- A leader is responsible for both the successes and failures of his or her team. Therefore, you need to be willing to accept blame when something does not go correctly.
- If your employees see their leader pointing fingers and blaming others, they will lose respect for you. Accept mistakes and failures, and then devise clear solutions for improvement. Here are some skills and qualities that help leaders convey their responsibility:
    - Acknowledging mistakes
    - Being open to customer feedback
    - Evaluating best solutions
    - Forecasting
    - Learning from past mistakes
    - Listening to feedback from employees and managers
    - Project planning
    - Reflectiveness
    - Resolving problems
    - Transparency
    - Trouble shooting
### Commitment
- It is important for leaders to follow through with what they agree to do. You should be willing to put in the extra hours to complete an assignment; employees will see this commitment and follow your example.
- Similarly, when you promise your staff a reward, such as an office party, you should always follow through. A leader cannot expect employees to commit to their jobs and their tasks if he or she cannot do the same. Some skills related to commitment in the workplace include:
    - Applying feedback
    - Commitment to company objectives
    - Determination
    - Embracing professional development

    - Keeping promises
    - Passion
    - Perseverance
    - Prioritization
    - Professionalism
    - Team player
    - Work ethic
### Flexibility
- Mishaps and last-minute changes always occur at work. Leaders need to be flexible, accepting whatever changes come their way. Employees will appreciate your ability to accept changes in stride and creatively problem solve.
- Similarly, leaders must be open to suggestions and feedback. If your staff is dissatisfied with an aspect of the office environment, listen to their concern and be open to making necessary changes. Employees will appreciate a leader's ability to accept appropriate feedback. Skills related to flexibility include:
    - Ability to learn new skills
    - Ability to respond to new problems or issues
    - Adaptability
    - Improvising
    - Negotiating
    - Open to feedback
    - Recognizing individuals’ strengths and skills
    - Treating employees as individuals

- then you might struggle to make the mark in the world of leadership. 
- You will have to set a good example for others to follow. 
- That is where your commitment, passion, empathy, honesty and integrity come into play. 
- Good communication skills and decision-making capabilities also play a vital role in success and failure of a leader. 
- Innovation and creative thinking, as well as the futuristic vision, are a couple of key traits which make a leader stand out.
