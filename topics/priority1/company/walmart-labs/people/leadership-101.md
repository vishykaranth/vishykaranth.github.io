## 101 Best Leadership Skills, Traits & Qualities – The Complete List
1. Self-motivated: 
Motivated leaders desire to achieve above and beyond expectations.
This comes from their passion, pride and desire to become better and the motivation to do things better than everyone else.
To succeed as a leader, you need to be motivated, and no one else can do that for you except your self.
Nothing will work unless you do. – Maya Angelou
2. Standards:
Leaders hold them selves and the people around them to a higher standard than most, both on a personal and professional level.
Leaders understand that in order to achieve higher standards, they need to have strong values, hold themselves accountable for their words/actions and never make excuses.
Remember you’re the average of the five people you spend the most time with.
3. Confidence:
Unfortunately, confidence can be one of those things you either have or don’t have, but I believe that it can be practiced and learned.
Confidence has to do with your inner perception of your ability to fulfill a particular role and is built through your experiences and dealings during your life.
To build your confidence you need to be open to new experiences and be willing to fail or you’ll never grow and find the strength needed to push the limits of what you’re capable of.
You gain strength, courage and confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face. – Eleanor Roosevelt
4. Optimism & Positivity:
Where others might think a project or task is too difficult, leaders face those challenges with energy and positivity.
Positivity is contagious, so be sure to focus on your attitude and understand you set the tone for your business and the people around you.
5. Accountable: 
Being accountable means that you accept responsibility for the outcomes expected of you, both good and bad.
You don’t blame others. And you don’t blame things that were out of your control.
Until you take responsibility, you are a victim. And being a victim is the exact opposite of being a leader.
Great leaders take initiative to influence the outcome and take responsibility for the results.
6. Courage:
Aristotle called courage the first virtue, because it makes all of the other virtues possible.
Leadership sometimes involves making unpopular decisions which requires a certain level of bravery.
If you want to be more courageous you need to try new things, have more trust and confidence in others, as well as be able to raise difficult issues that others would leave unresolved.
Keep your fears to yourself, but share your courage with others. – Robert Louis Stevenson
7. Engaged:
Great leaders are able to focus their attention on the problem at hand without being distracted.
Even when your extremely busy, you need to make sure that you’re participating in the process with team members and not giving orders from the sideline.
8. Character:
Leaders are well defined and have unique personas that make them one-of-kind.
They are full of personality and are not afraid to stand lone and be different.
They understand that the things who make them different are the things that define their character.
9. Humor:
Many leaders are perfectionists, which tends to make them critical of themselves and the people around them.
But let’s face it, what can go wrong, usually will go wrong. That’s life!
You should have a healthy sense of humor about life and not take your self too seriously (which can be difficult when you want others to take you seriously).
However, leaders who take them selves too seriously risk alienating people.
Effective leaders have the ability to laugh at them selves and understand that they are only human and can make mistakes like everyone else.
10. Passion:
Passionate leaders often have a strong, uncontrollable desire that pushes them forward.
The amount of passion you have directly affects your attitude, energy and that of your followers as well.
Use your excitement and to ignite the passion pf your followers!
You have to be burning with an idea, or a problem, or a wrong that you want to right. If you’re not passionate enough from the start, you’ll never stick it out. – Steve Jobs
11. Integrity:
Having strong moral values is an important leadership trait because it will allow others to clearly identify with you.
Having sincerity and honesty in all your dealings assures your followers of your intentions.
12. Respectable:
Enticing a deep sense of admiration and loyalty in your followers in key to successful leadership.
Being respected makes it easier to put your plans in action and have others quickly buy into your vision.
Leaders garner respect by letting their actions speak louder than their words.
13. Likable:
In some cases, leaders are respected for their negative qualities.
That’s why it’s important that you not only seek to be respected, but that you are likable as well.
It’s very obvious, people want to work with and be around people they like and distance themselves from people they don’t.
14. Ethical:
When dealing with tough (sometime moral) decisions, great leaders should do so in accordance with their own values and ensure their actions are positive, not damaging.
Also, when you govern the moral principles of the people you are leading, you can establish an unspoken ethics code that helps better guide their decisions and behavior.
15. Loyal:
When we are talking about loyalty and leadership it’s usually about the followers, but loyalty is not a one way street.
You need to give and show firm, constant support to your followers if you ever hope that they will give the same to you.
16. Charisma:
Successful leaders are magnetizing and charming which inspires devotion in their followers.
This charisma can be difficult to learn, it usually requires most people to go outside of their comfort zone by speaking with more strangers as well as learning how to command the attention and speak to a group of any size.
17. Appreciation/love for your career:
It might be cliché, but you really should be doing what you love and what you’re passionate about.
If you aren’t doing something you love, you’ll never find the drive to push your self to be better.
18. Emotional intelligence:
The ability to understand and manage your own emotions, and those of the people around you is crucial.
People with a high degree of emotional intelligence know what they’re feeling, what their emotions mean, and how these emotions can affect other people.
19. Emotional control:
Similar to emotional intelligence, once you can understand your emotions, you can learn to control them.
The ability to stay calm, assess your self, then make adjustments comes down to simple self-control.
If you can control your emotions and reactions to the world, you can better control the outcomes.
Life is 10 percent what happens to me and 90 percent of how I react to it. – Charles Swindoll
20. Understanding of opportunity cost:
Leaders know that many situations and decisions in business involve risk and there is an opportunity cost associated with every decision you make.
An opportunity cost is the cost of a missed opportunity. This is usually defined in terms of money, but it may also be considered in terms of time, person-hours, or any other finite resource.
Great leaders understand the consequences of their decisions before making them.
21. Humility:
Leaders should be humble by seeking out feedback and focusing on the needs of others.
You need to be open to people’s feedback and criticisms and know how to admit that you’re not perfect and when you’ve made a mistake.
There is no respect for others without humility in one’s self. – Henri Frederic Amiel

22. Discipline:
Discipline in leadership is less about punishing and rewarding others, but rather having self-control, inner calm and outer resolve.
A high level of determination and willpower play a significant part in your ability to be self-disciplined.
23. Perspective:
Sometime the best solution is right in front of us, but we are too close to see it.
Leaders know how to remove them selves from a situation and observe it from multiple perspectives with a open mind.
Unless you know the road you’ve come from, you cannot know where you are going. – African proverb
24. Risk management:
You need to identify, evaluate and address risks so you can positively affect the outcome by handling that risk in the best-suited way.
They often say, “there is now reward, without risk.”
But smart leaders know which risks to take and which to guard against.
25. Time management:
Great leaders know that time is their most valuable asset.
Leaders need to know how to effectively plans their time by knowing when and where to spend it; on your self, your business and family/friends.
Related: Time Management 101: Stop Managing Time
26. Self-assurance:
Every road to success to filled with people who will find any reason to give you why it won’t work.
You need a healthy level of self assurance that gives you a practical (sometime impractical) sense of faith in your cause that drives you forward with no excuses, roadblocks or negativity holding you back.
27. Maturity:
Contrary to popular belief, age is not a measure of maturity.
I’ve worked with young leaders who act like men and old men who act like teenagers.
Maturity comes from being courteous, knowing how to communicate like an adult and being the bigger person in difficult situations.
Also, your confidence in your self and your ability to follow through without excuses are strong indicators of maturity.

32. Honesty & Transparency:
There are no more secrets today, everything is out there on the worldwide web.

35. Listening:
In order to give your followers the feedback, support and attention they need to be successful, you need to make a true effort to listen when they speak.

Hard-word, dedication, and long-term focus are essential to authentic leadership.
38. Empathy & Compassion:

You need to know not only how your actions effect people, but what you need to do in order to show understanding and sympathy for others.

Stopping a problem earlier on will save a huge amount of time (not to mention headaches) versus leaving it unresolved.
40. Empowerment:
As a leader, you need to set others up for success by entrusting them to make good decisions.
Empowerment is not just about giving your followers the freedom to make their own choices, it’s about giving them the tools and processes to make those choices effectively and productively.
41. Negotiation skills:
Leaders know how to get what they want and can be very convincing (which can be good and sometimes bad).
They do this by tapping the desires of others and building a sense of trust with people in order to come to a desirable outcome.
From settling differences to overseeing a large deal, leaders should be practical, fair and firm in their negotiations.
42. Social savvy:
Did you know that 71% of all online adults use Facebook? That’s almost 1.2 billion people!
Smart leaders know that their followers’ and potential followers’ habits have changed. They are spending more time on social media than ever before.

43. Clarity:
When great leaders speak, they are able to clearly relay their thoughts in a way that’s easy to understand.
Then they make sure there are no miscommunications and that their point(s) got across clearly.
This ensures projects and tasks that are delegated get done the right way and without mistakes.
44. Ability to teach:
Leaders need to be able to share the methodologies and processes that make their business run with the people they work with and hire.
If your managers are poorly trained, your staff will be poorly trained and it will reflect in your sales and operations.
Remember the best way to learn something your self is to teach it!
45. Interested in feedback:

That involves being open to honest feedback and the ability to have a positive attitude about that feedback and use it make adjustments that benefit everyone.

They use that knowledge to decide who gets assigned which projects/tasks so that everything gets completed the right way.
49. Sharing your vision:
There are a lot of people out there who think they have the next great idea.
Sadly, as great as those ideas might be, they will never go anywhere if no one else knows about it.
Leaders have the ability to share their vision and get people to buy into their ideas.
50. Turning vision into reality:
Not only can leaders share their vision, they have the ability to break that vision down into steps and a strategy that can be understood by others and executed over time.
51. Get the best from others:
By understanding what people really want, you can help them better perform by properly incentivizing (not only with money) their work and progress towards larger goals.
To get the best from others a leader needs to understand their motivations, be positive, generous, open-minded and be able to control their attitude.

Monetary rewards are nice, but thoughtful, personal rewards can be more impactful.
55. Evaluative:
Great leaders are able to carefully and quickly analyze a situation and/or person.

People don’t like to be surprised, that’s why it’s important to layout and agree to the expectations in place so everyone is one the same page from day one.
To make sure expectations are crystal clear, start by providing structure, clarifying roles, set motivating goals and continuously give/ask for feedback.
61. Fair:
Some traits are more important than others.
When it comes to leadership, the ability to judge situations and people with fairness is essential because it shows them how you value them.

67. Ability to pivot:
The business world is changing quickly and will continue to do so.
Great leaders have the ability to recognize those changes and guide their organization and team accordingly.
Personal Story: One of the first businesses I started was focused on developing and designing mobile apps for retailers. Unfortunately, we were a little early to the party and found it difficult the line up consistent projects. We decided to take everything we learned marketing our own business (mobile websites, SEO, social media, etc.) and use that to help our clients successfully market their businesses. This pivot saved the business and set us up to do more than we ever thought possible.

68. Open minded:
It’s fascinating how many business owners and managers refuse to change the simplest aspects of their business because they have the “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” mentality.
While that might work for a time, as years pass the business and their leaders who refuse to learn, adapt and grow will be left behind.
To be an effective leader you need to be open to learning about new things and exploring new experiences.

The only person you are destined to become is the person you decide to be. – Ralph Waldo Emerson
75. Proactive:
The opposite of proactive is reactive, which means you react to the world around you instead of taking steps to positive effect the outcomes.
Proactive leaders have a DIY mindset and approach new/difficult situations with enthusiasm and energy.
If you want to positively effect you life and the lives around you, start by learning to control (not manipulate) situations to cause something to happen, rather than waiting for it to happen.
76. Flexible:
People in leadership positions are often gifted with flexible schedules.
Sure, we all work for someone, whether it’s stakeholders, clients or someone else, we usually have the ability to make our own schedules.
Leaders need to use this flexibility the become more available and involved in organization initiatives as well as other people’s lives.
77. Manage setbacks/uncertainty:
After any failure, big or small, you usually have two options: give up or find a better way.

Leaders know that value in keeping their personal and professional things (both physical and electronic) in order.
79. Creative:
Contrary to popular belief, creativity is not something people are born with, like many leadership skills it can be learned and practiced.
Go out of your way to explore new experiences, learn new things and practice open mindedness by continually asking new questions.
Personal Story: I believe that creativity in business comes from outside inspiration. For example, I enjoy cooking/grilling, interior design and graphic design (it helps that I have interior design and BBQ retail clients). But I make a point to find time for these creative activities which are not only therapeutic but they can also ignite my professional creativity. What are your creative outlets?

Life is full of distractions, great leaders know how to remain on track and block out distractions.
