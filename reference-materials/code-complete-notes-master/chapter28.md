### Chapter 28: Managing Construction

#### 28.1 Encouraging Good Coding
* Software standards are best set by an architect rather than a manager (only if the architect is respected by the coders for their technical prowess...)
* Techniques for encouraging good coding
  * Assign two people to each part of the project
  * Review every line of code (author + 2+ reviewers)
  * Require code sign offs
  * Route good code examples for review
  * All code as publicly available assets
  * Reward good code
  * One easy standard = I must be able to read and understand any code written for the project

#### 28.2 Configuration Management
* Configuration management is the practice of identifying project artifacts (components) and handling changes systematically so that a system can maintain its integrity over time
* Aka change control
* Requirements and design changes
  * Have a systematic change control procedure
  * Handle change requests in batches
  * Estimate the cost of each change (including code review and system testing)
  * Be wary of high volumes of changes (there may be design or requirements development left to do)
  * Establish a change control board
  * Watch for bureaucracy but don't let fear of bureaucracy preclude configuration management
* Software code changes - Version control software 
* Machine configurations
* Backup plan (plan for backing up everything that is needed to build the product and tests that recovery is successful)

#### 28.3 Estimating a Construction Schedule
* Establish objectives
  * Why do you need an estimate?
  * What are you estimating?
* Allow time for the estimate, and plan it
* Spell out requirements
* Estimate at a low level of detail
* Use several estimation techniques and compare the results
* Reestimate periodically
* The largest influence on a software project’s schedule is the size of the program to be produced
  * Remotely working is about 20% harmful
* The accuracy of the initial estimate is much less important than your subsequent success at controlling resources to meet the schedule
* What to do if you're behind
  * Hope that you'll catch up (however, projects do not make up lost time later, they fall further behind)
  * Expand the team (only helps if there are components of a project that can be split up, otherwise new members are likely to be worse for the project)
  * Reduce the scope of the project (drop the nice to have features or build cheaper versions)

#### 28.4 Measurement
* It is possible to measure any project attribute in a way that is superior to not measuring at all
* Be wary of measurement side effects: People tend to focus on work that’s measured and to ignore work that isn’t
* See pages 679-680 for additional resources on software measurement

#### 28.5 Treating Programmers as People
* Good programmers (and bad programmers) tend to cluster within teams and organizations
* Programmers get religious about programming style, IDEs, indentation, etc.

#### 28.6 Managing Your Manager
* Technically competent and up-to-date managers are rare
* Plant ideas for what you want to do
* Educate your manager about the right way to do things
* Focus on what your manager really wants you to do (avoid discussing unnecessary implementation details)
