### Chapter 20: The Software-Quality Landscape

#### 20.1 Characteristics of Software Quality
* See p464 for a list of external software quality characteristics and how they interact

#### 20.2 Techniques For Improving Software Quality
* Focus both on software product and software development process
* Software quality objectives based on internal and external characteristics in 20.1
* Explicit quality assurance in code quality
* Testing strategy
* Software engineering guidelines for all software development activities:
  * Problem definition
  * Requirements development
  * Architecture
  * Construction
  * System testing
* Informal technical reviews (self or peer review)
* Formal technical reviews
  * Use quality gates, periodic tests or reviews that determine whether the quality of the product is sufficient to support moving on to the next stage
* External audits
* Change control procedures
  * For changes to requirements, design, code, etc.
* Measurement of results of quality assurance plan
* Prototyping of a system's key functions
* Set well-defined and achievable software quality objectives

#### 20.3 Relative Effectiveness of Quality Techniques
* Percentage of defects detected for each quality technique
  * Unit and integration testing yield only 35% error detection each
  * Key is combining several quality techniques
  * Walking through code tends to be better for detecting interface defects
  * Tests tend to be better for detecting control defects
* Code inspections tend to be faster than testing to find errors

#### 20.4 When to Do Quality Assurance
* Defects creep into software at all stages, from design to construction to testing
* Emphasize quality assurance right from the start

#### 20.5 The General Principle of Software Quality
* **The General Principle of Software Quality is that improving quality reduces development costs**
* The best way to improve productivity and quality is to reduce the time spent reworking code, whether it arises from changes in requirements, changes in design, or debugging
* **The single biggest activity on most projects is debugging and correcting code that doesn't work properly**
* Debugging, refactoring, and rework consume 50% of time on a project
