### Chapter 27: How Program Size Affects Construction

#### 27.1 Communication and Size
* Communication increases proportional to the square of the number of participants
* It means greater potential to make mistakes and have errors in communication
* As projects grow, streamline or formalize communication in documents

#### 27.3 Effect of Project Size on Errors
* As project size goes up, number of errors due to design and requirements goes up, generally

#### 27.4 Effect of Project Size on Productivity
* Productivity goes down as project size goes up

#### 27.5 Effect of Project Size on Development Activities
* As project size goes up, construction time scales up but not as fast as system testing, architecture, integration, defect removal
* A software product (made for others to use and maintain) costs 3x as much as a software program (made for who wrote it or informally by a few others)
* A software system (set of programs that interact) costs 3x as much as a software program
* A system product costs 9x as much as a program
* Scaling up a lightweight methodology tends to work better than scaling down a heavyweight methodology
