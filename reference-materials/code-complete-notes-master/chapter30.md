### Chapter 30: Programming Tools

#### 30.2 Source Code Tools
* Lint is a picky syntax checker that checks beyond what the compiler checks for
* Metrics reporters will comment on code quality based on routine size or complexity, etc
* Data dictionary keeps track of data schema in databases or routine/class names and what they do in large projects

#### 30.3 Executable Code Tools
* Compiler converts source code into executable code
* Linkers link compiler-generated object files with standard code to make an executable program
  * Allows different parts of the program to be written in different languages
* Build tools (such as make) link source code files with target files and recompile only those target files that depend on source files that have changed
