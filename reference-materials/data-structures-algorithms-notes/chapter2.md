## Chapter 2: Recursion and Backtracking
* Recursion is most useful for tasks that can be defined in terms of similar subtasks
* Recursion adds overhead for each recursive call (space on the stack frame), as compared with the equivalent iterative operation
* Generally iterative calls are more efficient
* Backtracking is a method of exhaustive search using divide and conquer, by trying all possibilities
