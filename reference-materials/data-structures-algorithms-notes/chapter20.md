## Chapter 20: Complexity Classes
* P = set of decision problems that can be solved on a deterministic machine in polynomial time
  * Solutions are easy to find
* NP = set of problems that can be solved on a non-deterministic machine in polynomial time
  * Hard to solve, easy to verify
* Co-NP = "no" answer can be given in polynomial time on a non-deterministic machine
* NP-hard = takes a long time to check whether the solution is correct
* NP-complete = NP and NP-hard
